# PubMed_text_mine

This code is a Python script that uses the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
library and the PubMed API to extract and analyze information from a
scientific paper. The script starts by setting up a request to the PubMed
API by defining an API key, the PubMed ID of the paper to be analyzed,
and the URL of the API endpoint. The script then sends the request and
parses the XML data returned by the API using the ElementTree library.
The script extracts the full text of the paper by traversing the XML
tree structure and searching for the Abstract and Article elements.
